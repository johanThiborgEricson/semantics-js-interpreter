Write test to check that assigning to variable statements only affects the 
  current execution context.
It seems that distinguishing between variable names and this can't be done 
  with predecence alone. Negative lookahead: match this not followed by
  IdentifierPart. No. Implement but not in atoms.
ExecutionEnvironment.variables should be lexical environment.
Remove list quantifiers from the grammar (and from the code?).
Which literals may have qualifiers?
New expressions should return the result of the constructor if it is an object.
  return (typeof result === "object" && result) || object; // p. 47
New expressions without arguments gets a function with no parameters, not an
  arguments object.
Are the properties of window own properties?
