Write test to check that assigning to variable statements only affects the 
  current execution context.
It seems that distinguishing between variable names and this can't be done 
  with predecence alone. Negative lookahead: match this not followed by
  IdentifierPart. No. Implement but not in atoms.
ExecutionEnvironment.variables should be lexical environment.
Remove list quantifiers from the grammar (and from the code?).
Which literals may have qualifiers?
New expressions should return the result of the constructor if it is an object.
  return (typeof result === "object" && result) || object; // p. 47
  is this true also for typeof result === "function"?
Are the properties of window own properties?
Move string tests to seperate file.
regexp doesn't handle spaces yet.
Write group tests to check that non returned sideffects ar still run, so I 
  don't accidentally disable them with select(4)
Ensure that insignificant space is parsed before and after literal 
  strings and regexes.
