Write test to check that assigning to variable statements only affects the 
  current execution context.
It seems that distinguishing between variable names and this can't be done 
  with predecence alone. Negative lookahead: match this not followed by
  IdentifierPart. No. Implement but not in atoms.
ExecutionEnvironment.variables should be lexical environment.
Remove list quantifiers from the grammar (and from the code?).
Which literals may have qualifiers?
The parse fail alternative of opt should be a function, not a value. Values
  are too scary.
